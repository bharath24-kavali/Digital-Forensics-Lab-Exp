# Experiment 1: Evidence Acquisition Using FTK Imager

## Aim
To capture RAM data and create a forensic disk image using FTK Imager.

## Requirements
- FTK Imager
- Windows Operating System

## Description
- FTK Imager creates bit-by-bit forensic images of hard drives, partitions, and other storage media, preserving the original data, including file slack and unallocated space, without altering it.
- It allows investigators to preview files, folders, and forensic images on various media types, supporting analysis tasks like keyword searching, metadata extraction, and file type identification.
- The tool generates MD5 and SHA1 hash values to verify the integrity of forensic images, ensuring they remain unchanged and admissible in court.

## Acquiring Volatile Memory (RAM) Using FTK Imager

### Step-1
Right-click on FTK Imager and run as Administrator.

### Step-3
A box will appear. Select the destination path for your file and provide the file name with a `.mem` extension. Pagefile and AD1 file options are optional.

### Step-4
A green progress bar will indicate the capture status. The time taken to capture the RAM depends on the RAM size. After completion, the memory dump file will be available in the destination folder.

### Step-2
In the dialog box, choose the source evidence type (e.g., Physical Drive, Logical Drive, Image File, or Contents of a Folder)

### Step-5
Select the image type from the dialog box (Raw, SMART, E01, AFF). E01 is recommended.

### Step-7
Choose the destination folder and provide a file name for the image.

### Step-8
Set options like compression and splitting size, then click **Finish** to start the imaging process.
